# 2024 Advent of Code

## This is my first go at it

## Running

Set an `AOC_SESSION` env for your session. The `aoc_request` will pull in your 
input and save it to the days file. The program will then use the cache.

To run the go program run

`go run day_#.go aoc_request.go`

I plan to improve the above but not at the moment.
